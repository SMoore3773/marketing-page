# marketing-page

The marketing-page for Essentialism is the landing page, and subsequent 'about us' page that gives a brief explanation of what Essentialism is offering. The 'about us' or 'team' page gives insight into who is behind Essentialism.  

The design theory behind the landing page was to use images that are considered calming and meditative. The intent of the overall layout was to have one thing being on screen and the focus of attention at a time. Sticky headers and fixed backgrounds assure a minimal amount of moving parts on screen at a time. Minimum widths on sections of the page assure that the visitor is able to focus on one section at a time without distraction. Cool colors and muted tones were used to provide a calm atmosphere to the page. Clean text and rounded edges for on-page elements are there to soften harsh corners and promote a soothing feel to the page.

This page was designed with mobile format prioritized because the majority of users are using mobile devices to access online media. Attention was given to how the page appears and flows on a mobile-sized screen, then adapted outward for larger screen sizes. The page retains similar functionality at larger sizes compared to smaller. The design philosophy of the page fascilitated the use of a similar layout for all screen sizes.

Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
1. An on-boarding process for a new user
2. Create a page that shows a list of values. User will swipe right or left (or tap a check or x button) if that value is important to them. (List: Athletic ability • Art and literature • Creativity, discovering, or inventing things to make a difference in the world • Independence • Kindness and generosity • Living in the moment • Membership in a social group (such as your community, racial group, or school club) • Music • My community • My moral principles • Nature and the environment • Relationships with friends and family • Sense of humor • Success in my career • Other: _________________).
3. Create a page that then shows the list of values the person chose. Prompt the user to now choose the top 3 that are the MOST important to them. Then give students the prompt: In a few sentences, describe why the selected values are important to you. Focus on your thoughts/feelings, and don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or how well-written it is.
4. Prompt to list all your current projects and things you’re involved in
5. Page to Compare your values to your current projects.
6. Ability to easily edit / delete all data.
